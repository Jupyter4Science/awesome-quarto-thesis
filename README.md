<p align='center'>
A list of Quarto templates designed to produce a university thesis or dissertation
<br><br>

Welcome! I'm glad you found this awesome hand-curated list of Quarto dissertation and thesis extensions (as of 2024-03-06). 

### What is Quarto
Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. For the purposes of this list, Quarto is a tool that let's you write a dissertaion in markdown files (which can contain LaTeX, code, and other content). Those markdown files can then be rendered to a PDF which fulfils the formatting requirements of your university. To learn more about Quarto, please visit the [Quarto documentation site](https://quarto.org/) and the [Awesome Quaro](https://github.com/mcanouil/awesome-quarto) list!

### What are Quarto extensions
[Quarto extensions](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/) are a powerful way to modify and extend the behavior of Quarto in repeatable and reusible ways. While it is probably possible to achieve a thesis or dissertation using Quarto without first building a Quarto extensions, those kinds of repositories aren't currently included on this list. Quarto extensions are easy for other people to use. They are also good practice because they encourage modularity. Extensions can be edited and adopted by multiple contributors working toward the same goal. 

### Fulfilling University Requirements
Theses and dissertations represent an incredibly clear cut goal because universities often have very strict formatting requirements for these PDF documents. Thus, there is not a lot of preference involved and it makes sense for people to work together to make the best template they can for their university. Therefore, this list is organized by university. 

### Using Quarto Extensions
[Quarto extensions](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/creating.html) provide custom formatting for reuse by others. The developers of the repositories listed have done the work of creating a university formatted template for you to use. You can install their extensions to format your own Quarto markdown project in one line:

```
quarto install extension <owner>/<repository>
```

### Contributions Encouraged
The information in this list may not be perfectly accurate. I tried to sort out extensions that look completed (I could find a rendered PDF in the repository) from those that still seem to be in active or inactive development. If you see a missing or mislabeled repository, please submit an issue or a pull request. I'm very interested in combining efforts to improve the ecosystem, so if you have ideas for collaboration, please reach out!
